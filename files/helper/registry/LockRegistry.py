class LockRegistry:
    """
    Responsible for managing a registry of locks. Implements a singleton pattern
    to ensure a single instance manages all lock registrations. Each lock is
    identified by a unique key, allowing for thread-safe operations within a
    multithreaded application. This ensures consistency and provides mechanisms
    to avoid race conditions within the scope of lock management.

    The class maintains its singleton nature via a private static instance and
    uses a thread lock to manage instantiation as well as access to the internal
    dictionary of locks.

    :ivar _instance: Static instance of the singleton LockRegistry class.
    :type _instance: LockRegistry
    :ivar _lock: A lock to ensure thread-safe creation of the singleton instance.
    :type _lock: threading.Lock
    :ivar locks: A dictionary containing thread locks with unique keys.
    :type locks: dict
